## Patterns
### Unbundling Business Modules
- Unbundling the corporation derives from the concept of three types of businesses: customer relationship business, product innovation businesses, and infrastructure businesses
- Ideally, the types of businesses are unbundled into separate entities and do not co-exist in a single corporation
### The Long Tail
- Selling many niche items where a small number of bestsellers account for most revenues
- Low inventory costs and strong platforms to make niche content readily available to interested buyers.
- Examples are selling books and Legos
### Multi-sided Platforms
- Brings together 2+ distinct and interdependent groups of customers
- Value is derived from one group _only if_ the groups are present thereby facilitating interactions between different groups
- Grows in value to the extent that more users are attracted to the platform (aka network effect)
- Examples include Game consoles, App store, Social Media
### Free as a Business Model
- At one substantial **CS** is able to _continuously benefit_ from a free of charge offer.
- Non-paying customers are financed by another part of the business model or by another **CS**.
- Freemium, Open Source, Advertising
